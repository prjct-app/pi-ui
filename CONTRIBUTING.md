# Contributing

- Integration branch: `main`. Create a feature branch from `main`.
- Deliver changes through a pull request using `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
- Use English for code, documentation, tests, issues, and pull requests.
- Use strict TypeScript and only APIs documented by Pi 0.85.1.
- Keep the package manifest limited to one extension entry point, `index.ts`.
- Do not import host internals, monkey-patch prototypes, or access real credentials, sessions, or user configuration in tests.
- Keep runtime dependencies in `dependencies`; list Pi-provided packages in `peerDependencies` with a `*` range.
- Run `npm run check`, `npm test`, and `npm pack --dry-run` before review.
- Build the compiled local copy Pi loads with `npm run build:pi`. It writes `~/.pi/agent/builds/<package>` outside the repository, because compiled code inside it would load the repository's development copy of Pi instead of the host's.
- Never push, open or merge a pull request, publish, or deploy without explicit authorization.

## Package documentation

Follow [docs/package.md](docs/package.md). Keep README examples consistent with registered commands and verify `npm run check:package` before release.
